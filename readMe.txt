1. This is a Java program where you can search the keyword in multiple file irrespective of their size and types such as (pdf, txt, doc & docx) within just mili seconds. 
This not only shows the files containing the keyword but also the precedence order of files containing the keyword.

2. Install Eclipse IDE into your system. 
Download https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

3. Download and import the following libraries.
* Pdfbox https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi
  Use for functionalities on pdf

* Poi https://poi.apache.org/download.html
  Use for functionalities on doc

* Xmlbeans https://xmlbeans.apache.org/download/
  Use for functionalities on docx

We don’t need any additional library for reading txt file because it’s pre installed with Eclipse IDE.

NOTE: I have uploaded all the needed libraries jars in External Archives, you can directly use them.

4. Copy and past the code of FideCode.java on Eclipse IDE and save it with FileCode.java extension.

5. Edit the path of folder in the code which has the files to be searched.
Example "C:\\Users\\user\\workspace\\destination-folder-name\\"

6. Run the code and follow the instructions on the console.

7. Enjoy – Thankyou for reading.
